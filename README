In theory, this plugin provides a framework for context-sensitive 
tags-based completion and code skeletons (requires tSkeleton vimscript 
#1160). I.e. the completion function checks the context and filters the 
available tags accordingly. You should thus get only those tags included 
in the list that are actually useful in a given context (eg because the 
are valid methods of a certain class).

In practice, the context sensitivity is currently only implemented for 
Java and requires a tags file for the JDK sources to be created (see the 
notes on |tlib#tag#Retrieve()| for details). It also makes certain 
assumption about how variable declarations look like, e.g. the 
class/type name should be in the same line as the variable name; class 
names start with an upper-case letter etc.

Limitation: you have to type g:ttagecho_min_chars = 1 chars before
completion is allowed.

It shouldn't be too difficult to adapt this for other statically typed 
languages with formal variable declarations. As the source code isn't 
actually parsed or anything, there is little chance to use this 
efficiently with dynamically typed languages like ruby where the 
type/class is only known at run-time.
